1.anaconda-ks.cfg is the original geneated after we install the bootisos on a VM.
  we can use it as a template for our own emm ks.cfg
y
2. ks.cfg is used for build out emm iso, which contains all emm's customization.

3. the encrypted root pwd is generated using algo of sha-512 with salt, see below:
   python -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("Nsky@0!6", "$6$nqskysalt"))'
   
   for the mdm user 'nationskymgt', we use
   python -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("su@ba%ma", "$6$nqskysalt"))'
   

4. for the disk partition, use xfs file system instead of ext4 in 3.4
